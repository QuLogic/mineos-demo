MINEOS DEMO run example
-----------------------

This directory contains all necessary information to run a control test for
the MINEOS package. To run the test, follow the instructions below.

 1. Check that MINEOS binary programs are accessible via the PATH environment
    variable:

    $ which minos_bran

 2. Start main script RUN_MINEOS.sh with command

    $ ./RUN_MINEOS.sh prem_noocean

    The RUN_MINEOS script runs minos_bran, eigcon, green and syndat MINEOS
    programs for a computation of the fundamental spheroidal and toroidal
    modes. The results are stored in test_S and test_T databases
    (eigenfunctions); in green database (Green functions); and in Syndat
    (synthetic seismograms). Files prem_noocean_S, prem_noocean_T,
    eprem_noocean_S and eprem_noocean_T are output of the minos_bran program.
    Compare results with precomputed ones in DEMO2 directory to be sure that
    everything works OK. Note that results in DEMO2 had been computed on a SUN
    platform and binary files have BIG_ENDIAN order.

 3. Convert synthetic seismograms to SAC format with command

    $ cucss2sac Syndat Syndat_SAC

    SAC waveforms will be placed in the Syndat_SAC directory. If you don't
    have the sac program, skip this step.

 4. Convert synthetic seismograms to ASCII format with command

    $ cucss2sac -a Syndat Syndat_ASC

    ASCII files will be placed in Syndat_ASC directory. Compare waveforms with
    waveforms in DEMO2/Syndat_ASC directory.

 5. If you have ANTELOPE software you may see the test results (Green functions
    and synthetic seismograms) directly on a SUN's platform, for example,

    $ dbpick Syndat
    or
    $ dbpick green

    Note that ANTELOPE always requires BIG_ENDIAN waveform data order. So, if
    test is running on a PC/Linux platform you need to convert waveforms from
    LOW_ENDIAN bytes order to BIG_ENDIAN in the following way:

    $ ./RUN_ENDIAN.sh Syndat
    $ ./RUN_ENDIAN.sh green

 6. Convert eigen functions (n=0,l=6,7,8) to ASCII format

    $ eigen2asc 0 0 6 8 test_S test_S_ASC

    Converted ASCII files will be in test_S_ASC dir.
    Compare with files in DEMO2 dir.
